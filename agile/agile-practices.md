# Agile

## Refactoring

The process of improving the internal structure of the code without changing its external behaviour. well factored code allow us to solve problems faster

1. higher quality
2. Enhanced technical agility
3. Enhance business agility
4. Code Kata: A technique for learning new coding skills.

## Agile mindset

There are different ways of working. breakdown the requirements into agile.

### HOW to get the agile

- by looking into the team mindsets
- Think like an agile team
- think about reasoning behind them
- 2 weeks long sprints
- think to work together
- AGILE teams are more productible and more collaborative
- short term planning
- everyone knows about everything
- flexibility to make decisions to make changes

### Values

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan

### Principles

2 welcoming changes even at later stage. for customerâ€™s competitive advantage
3 7 continuous delivery Deliver frequently
4 developers and customers work closely together
5 11 small, motivated Self-organized team of generalists
6 importance of face to face conversation. user stories instead of long documentation
1 8 9 10 Prioritize high value work. satisfy the customer by providing early and continuous delivery of valuable software Maintain constant pace
12 frequently discuss process improvement

embrace change and free to experiment

Instead of focussing on eliminating work think of different ways to do the work.

### The cost of multi tasking

Reducing multi tasking is one of the original ideas of Agile scrum
Focus on a limited set of high value tasks
Hand offs
Finishing work on a task and handing it over to another person for processing

Avoid handoffs - large batches of work to go through the system.

Sprint

a timeboxed iteration of work intended to deliver a shippable portion of product in a shorter time scale.

Planning != delivery
prefer short term predictable delivery
should be cross - functional

User story forces the product owner to think about the customer value, need to find out the customer values from the user stories so that a developer can find out ways to satisfy the customer.

### Sprint

1. Sprint planning meeting less than 2 hours short term planning
2. stand up for daily scrum less than 15 minutes
3. Sprint review - less than 2 hours of product review customer feedback
4. sprint retrospective
5. Deliver the product in shorter time scale
6. incrementally and iteratively
7. focus on the value

### Scrum

1. It is not part of Agile manifesto
2. Agile is a mindset and Scrum helps in embracing that mindset
3. In this framework, the team might learn something new and then work with the customer to quickly improve the product.

### Extreme Programming

1. focus on software development
2. agile planning , continuous integration , refactoring , TDD
3. Known a XP, extreme programming enables software teams to work quickly, continuously integrate, and improve their software over time.

### Kanban
